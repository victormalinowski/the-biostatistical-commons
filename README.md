## Overview  

The **Biostatistical Commons** is an initiative of the **Biostatistics Section of the Statistical Society of Canada (SSC)**, founded in **November 2025**.  

It serves as a shared space for learning, teaching, and reference materials in biostatistics — including tutorials, datasets, applications, and other educational resources.  

Built with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), the site aims to make biostatistical knowledge more open, accessible, and collaborative.
