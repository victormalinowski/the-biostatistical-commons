Welcome to the **Global Biostatistical Commons**, a curated collection of learning and teaching resources, developed by the Biostatistics Section of the Statistical Society of Canada.

Our aim is to make it easier for students, researchers, and instructors to find clear, practical materials for modern biostatistics.

## Start here

- [**Glossary & Definitions**](glossary.qmd)    
  Get a quick orientation to core biostatistical ideas and terminology.  

- [**Tutorials & Examples**](tutorials.qmd)   
  Short, applied examples with code (regression models, survival analysis, longitudinal data).  

- [**Common Challenges**](challenges.qmd)   
  Notes on frequent issues in practice (e.g. power, convergence, model checking, missing data).  
  
- [**Foundational Papers**](papers.qmd)   
  Links to foundational biostatistical papers (e.g. on double robustness, inverse weighting).   
  
- [**Publishing Guidelines**](publishing.qmd)   
  Instructions for publishing in biostatistical journals (e.g. Statistics in Medicine, Biometrika).   

- [**External Resources**](external/index.qmd)  
  Interactive apps, workshop materials, videos and blogposts, and other selected external links.  

## Who this site is for

- **Students and trainees** looking for approachable explanations and code examples  
- **Collaborators and researchers** who want quick references and practical guidance  
- **Instructors and supervisors** seeking materials to share in courses, labs, or journal clubs
